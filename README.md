## Description

This project aimed to create a website that used front and back-end code to a Note Taker app. When visiting the site the user is presented with a homepage and a "Get Started" button. Clicking the button brings the user to note taker page. On the Note taker page the user can create new notes by clicking the "New Note" button, filling out a note title and text and clicking then clicking the "Save Note" button. Saved notes are then displayed on the left side of the page. By clicking on saved notes, users can view the note title and text of that note. Users can also delete notes by clicking the delete button on any saved note.

This project highlighted the use of the Express package to write server code using JS. The project used several methods to modify and set content on the page including get, post, and delete. Finally the project used reading and writing to a JSON file to save and store persistent data rather than using the method of local storage that was used preiously.
